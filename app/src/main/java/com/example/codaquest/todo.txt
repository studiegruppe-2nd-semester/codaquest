PROBLEM / RØD TRÅD:
- The users learn the most while working on their own projects
- Many users want more repetition and more exercises than what the school gives them
- Does our app actually help the users?
- Will the users actually continue to use it or even use it to begin with?
- What feedback do the users have to make the app better? What is missing?
- Could this app help you expand your CV?
- Find people who will download the app and use it in a specified period
- How can we connect our app to the users pc since that is where they will code?
    - What if the share feature copies a link to drive or something where the project has been
        turned into a README file? then the file can easily be downloaded to your pc project repo
- Maybe make a new survey about projects and exercises and about our app

1. loading feature when generating project
2. Category to idea block users
